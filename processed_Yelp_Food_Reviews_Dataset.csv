One wit whiz ... cash hand I felt thoroughly prepared toe toe cheesesteak face-off Was sandwich bad No Was amazing worth repeat visit It wa The steak wa tender lacked real flavor The whiz wa warm melty nothing exciting Overall wa pretty mediocre sandwich interesting experience none less If 're Philly I 'd still recommend visiting comparing Why say visited birthplace cheesesteak,1

731,Taking walk across street I opportunity take Philly cheese steak challenge In personal opinion I think everything way steak wa cut roll wa better Geno 's Make sure know order go give crap n't,1
732,Geno 's Steak ..... 're Geno 's might well try Pat 's cheesesteak since 's across one another Seems modern term set cash register store front The long line long tradition make worth,1
733,The best cheesesteak I 've ever Fast friendly service I 'd come everyday I lived nearby Place clean I gave le star using ammonia glass cleaner smell horrible eating enjoying cheesesteak,1
734,So neither Pat 's Geno 's really good There like place within spitting distance better They simply famous That said `` stops tour '' 're visiting get steak decide I would say actual quality Geno 's generally le stellar although line generally shorter better seating Also almost want like big neon gaudiness Geno 's give edge Pat 's 's little goofy ... especially get weird almost religious poster And look around minute odds 're going see something slightly racist offensive sign confederate flag All free speech like folk NE metro area ... I probably going exercise right take business place either le outwardly racist least ha common business sense keep,1
735,Nope Go Pat 's across street better quality meat cheesesteak option menu way better fries,1
736,Not good Steve 's area 's worth ... tourist trap wit without,1
737,Real Philidelphians n't eat Genos tourist n't know better see crappy obnoxious lights Ask around city local better place,1

739,Tourist trap Outstanding cheese fry though,1

743,Amazing I took ride Pennsylvania girlfriend cousin starving cousin told place went I eneded getting cheese steak good line wa long moved fast quick dont forget fry lol,1
744,Geno 's definitely Philadelphia icon steak really average They seem giving le steak sandwich year well maybe head P If friend visiting town take But everyday cheese steak I 'd visit local pizza shop,1
745,We arrived midnight difficulty finding place park place sit eat The table line sidewalk I ordered cheesesteak else tourist Maybe I wa expecting something different I Jersey ... wa disappointing The cheesesteak ha chuck steak exceptionally chewy cheese failed improve overall experience It n't particular flavor stood wa honestly forgettable except prices It expensive In city full flavor variety .... I try somewhere else next time,1
746,Way expensive get You pay le elsewhere get better food Not 's cracked,1
747,When Philly one must try authentic PHILLY CHEESESTEAK SANDWICH I n't though I n't eat beef I came two friend huge carnivore foodies They got philly cheesesteak And also learned order melted cheese It 's called wist Or something like haha I got pork sandwich wist The pork wa okay Was n't spectacular n't extremely flavored But vibe made Everyone wa enthusiastic sandwiches The line also n't incredulously long one wa grouchy Overall worth try Especially n't Philly like,1
748,Decided go Geno 's verus Pat 's two week ago Philly That might mistake The sandwich wa mostly bread lacked flavor The cheese fry okay We lucky enough get little table I wa impressed Wish I could 've tried Pat 's,1
749,I 'm similar review two rival I loved Geno 's Pat 's They amazing Four u went try amazing cheesesteaks two u got Geno 's two u got Pat 's split We went back fourth one liked better great Geno 's bread wa fresh pretzel like texture outside They put cheese first meat onions The meat wa juicy I loved cheese sunk right delicious bread You try two Philly,1
750,Geno 's great spot experience Whether stopping sporting event long night drinking Geno 's serve No 's best cheese steak city even long shot But someone I know come visit city first time experience worth trip alone,1
751,I 'm sorry cheese steak place le taste I prefer Jim 's mostly 's le eyesore,1
752,The flavor lack chopped preparation steak letdown Alas I 'll stick Pat 's Dalessandros,1
753,This may seem crazy I 'm giving fiver something I 've never tasted anywhere else hot sauce I tried recently used leftover container small portion food blown away Not sure make 's company highly-noxious tasty red goodness If jalapeno hot long hot would kill ya ... stay away That aside ... enjoy End note I also commend Joey Vento stood especially South Philadelphian like I 'm inbred old-timer either In early 's college-educated,1
754,I returned road trip Philly I opportunity visit Geno 's For n't know Geno 's half block Pat 's We gave nod Geno 's daughter recently tried establishment preferred roll onion Geno 's Although n't really thrilled either place Im must agree Quite frankly Cheesesteaks couple local home town spot much better Puzo 's The Caboose Corner located Fairfield NJ FAR superior every way Better roll better quality quantity meat much larger variety custom toppings I come conclusion legendary `` Great Philly Cheesesteak '' complete myth I wo n't back,1
755,Between two competitor I chose pat Genos grizzly meat lot straight fat pat meat wa juicy fast wa trimmed Also comparison bread pat soft bread geno 's wa crusty Similar price andI also liked geno 's service little better Never le 's good food spot try tourists,1
756,Over rated,1
757,I come Philly Cheese Steak Honestly need say like bread steak ...,1
758,Overpriced nothing special Rather spend type money large Big Mac still money left lotto tickets Would recommend anyone place Racist hoIe started English bull Everyone stop going Even tourist Cause people Philly know cheesesteaks know go get good one place geno 's pat 's,1
759,I 'm sure place n't need review heck Here goes ... I wa told several people I needed choose either Pat 's Geno 's visiting Philadelphia By sheer chance I ended going Geno 's After hype I wa really expecting amazing cheese steak sandwich In actuality I thought sandwich wa alright I wa good n't get wrong I wa expecting mindblowingly tasty experience orgasmic proportion based everything wa told The meat wa kind bland dry overall sandwich wa kind flat Again nothing special Truth told I think I 've better cheese steak sandwich Denver places There 's place Broadway I still remember pretty amazing day visited year ago But knows maybe I wa exceptionally hungry I tried place,1
760,Geno 's `` English-only '' sign ignorant unwelcoming The cheesesteak Pat 's right across street taste better anyway Although I admit neither Pat 's Geno 's wa amazingly good,1
761,Typical tourist steak joint People Philadelphia eat unless drunk a.m,1
762,Pretty good Way better Denver I like Pat 's better It 's meatier use real Cheez wiz The meat ha something Pat 's n't I ca n't put figure It little better The service terrible They fun good visit Best town Sonny 's,1
763,Do n't waist time I 'm Philadelphia whole life People go name .... Pats People coming visit city food really n't good local eat South philly ha million really tasty food spots But Geno 's Pats n't one Put way I wa drunk hungry husband another couple wa late nothing wa opened go I could n't even eat food drunk hungry That 's pretty bad however cool location 9th street Oh n prepared spend lot money,1
764,I thought sandwich wa delicious wa hubby 's We got one different cheese could share The fry yummy What stuck food wa attitude employees They friendly funny truly made great experience,1
765,So ... visiting Pat 's Geno 's wa next stop I made sure order thing I Pat 's cheesesteak wit provolone except I n't think Geno 's ha mushrooms .... I got sandwich I slowly unwrap ..... magic faeries ..... oh well I n't know .... traveling way I thought would sort magical aura ... quickly made cheesesteak I ate found I Geno 's guy On particular day onion meat ratio wa almost one one Geno 's Pat 's ha meat little onion .... wa difference That fact cheese slice Geno 's thinner melted little faster ... blend flavor The bun wa still nice soft onion soaking flavor juice well seasoned grill made cheesesteak better My wife ordered cheese fry good well Crunchy fry soft cheese sauce .... good times,1
766,Steaks ok best Philly never go Joey Vento hate mongering wa alive,1
767,This place wa expected Beginning rudest service woman blonde hair saying nasty comments This wa first time last Food wa OK went Pats Two server seem like wanted rude stare comments I drove hour try place VERY disappointed Also rated bad area Maybe live There expectation,1
768,We took family Geno/Pat test I 'm GENO 's fan YAHOOO The bread made difference The people well I liked wit'out Everytime company come town Geno/Pat comparison Geno 's win every time Oh wait Pat 's one person Massachusetts know hmmph eat boiled dinners GO GENO 's,1
769,Food I honestly liked Geno 's Steaks Pat 's n't dry bread wa somewhat crispy However I still see problem I Pat 's Geno 's The meat wa somewhat dry like ha sitting grill long sell unfortunately They definitely better fry compared Pat 's wa honestly like choosing better poisons Price A little le expensive Pat 's I would come back pay Service Slightly better Pat 's wa definitely superb I would return So overrated I wa upset end,1
770,Finally cheese steak thing In comparison flavor Pat 's wins Very disappointed price quantity neither meat wa half sandwich Geno 's inviting atmosphere friendlier staff Meat taste old blood roll wa warm meat wa hot I 'll stick South Jersey cheese steaks Seagraves Italian Kitchen competition Same price twice size tree time meat,1
771,Geno steak good place rated .... pick place south philly I would go tony luck front Oregon,1
772,I lived Philadelphia years came handful times However I returned year moving West Coast decided partake head head competition Pat 's versus Geno 's We ordered steak sandwich identical wit Wiz Onions split one half shared We agreed enjoyed Pat 's bit better Both redeeming qualities however thought Pat 's flavor profile wa bit better Geno 's Our opinion however produced quality steak I must say Geno 's get one le star despite pretty good We ordered soda steak Geno 's however refused give u cup water despite purchasing steak soda The service issue wa really satisfactory,1
773,Thought place wa better Pat 's Bread wa fantastic texture flavor Steak WAS NOT grubbie chewie Pats The cheese wa flavorful We cheese fry ... Soo good They accept cash Be aware I wa pleased back The steak wa tender wet savory Perfectly spiced nice salty,1
774,good food overrated ate bunch times really bad make fast long line dont really spend time cooking meat correctly pat geno 's going drain,1
775,Not good When get Geno 's first thing 'll notice ultra-bright white neon light look like cross cafeteria ER waiting room The cheese steak I got one provolone wa limp semi-cold devoid flavor I could n't even tell cheese A disappointment Also maybe I n't like whiz fry whiz inedible On side note 's sign warns patron `` This America speak English '' This sound xenophobic Why confrontational towards foreigners Are people work Geno 's able speak local language every time travel abroad French fry indicated Freedom Fries menu I n't think wa joke Perhaps Geno 's even donated money return Statue Liberty France time Iraq invasion Finally various police emblems circumstance could seen colorful interesting collection end contributing overall unwelcoming menacing ambiance -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- PS If like 're planning nice long walk downtown get neighborhood evening think Although necessarily unsafe 'll walk dilapidated neighborhood completely empty street reaching destination,1
776,Geno 's best Pat 's Tony Lukes The onion make cheesesteak really good They could def add meat sandwich make little better always fan place Advice n't order slow window know want These people patience lol,1
777,Ok I talked shit got bit I admit Was picking friend airport p. M flight wa delayed hour instead sitting airport I drove city I drove first Geno 's steak thought cheese whiz thing wa cracked tried first time wa damn good funny though get steak one window go different window get drink thought wa weird I like place good go go,1
778,Not sure hype Yes place Pat 's got fame tv show famous celebrities famous food .... much Geno 's seems get fame business tourism I wa pretty eager try authentic Philly Cheeseteak see match one local back Cali First line wa wrapped around block best part wa line moved quickly You get window blurt sandwich order pay buck lady The sandwich came minutes want drink move next window order rest meal fries soda Ready eat sandwich I unwrap literally looked like pile microwaved meat stuck ordinary roll The bread wa tough chewy inside without hint toasting crisp outside Meat wa pretty bland wa small piece like getting last bag chips The thing I could really taste wa provolone cheese In short tasted like microwaved frozen sandwich Also got LARGE soda wa oz I know american overweight Large large .. oz-24 oz minumum esp 're paying top prices Lastly also order fry dollars yes DOLLARS Fries served paper cup look like seasoned fry n't make wonder kind oil use Ate first fry I immediately nasty oil/film coating left mouth Felt like plastic melting mouth A complete tasteless meal bux know guy stay business shiny light night Someone ha pay electric bill Do n't recommend place novelty get share tourist wa def one fall tourist trap Oh remember according sign front n't speak Engrish n't bother cuz 're welcome,1
779,I wa excited try authentic Philly cheesesteak spent entire ride airport thinking sandwich overflowing meat peppers onion cheese `` wiz '' I wa disappointed turned roll anything else Very skimpy filling I barely needed napkin I wa also put `` America please order English '' sign window I speak English would expect hospitality le blatant hostility place dependent visit tourist If I noticed sign I ordered I would 've taken business across street Pat 's,1
780,I grew PA live Cali husband I took family east coast course husband go Service wa fast I got steak sandwich onion whiz Super cheesy delicious bread wa soft Steak wa like small round patty 's loved I actually ate Pat 's steak sandwich time I wa comparing two Geno 's wa cheesier,1
781,Not good steak Gummy bread Worse so-so inedible But really set place apart ample side serving xenophobia meaty blob crypto-facism After looking around place sign proudly claiming serve anyone n't speak English mention collection badge button rival police museum I wa sorry I gave creepy establishment dime let alone But ... created lifetime memory son He kept asking whole time place like still business Good question son,1
782,Honestly I liked Geno 's Steaks `` Big '' Geno 's Pat 's Tony Luke 's I ordered cheesesteak american cheese onions The bread wa crisp outside chewy inside cheese complimented steak really well Also keep mind I also went across street cheesesteak Pat 's wa similar,1

804,Geno 's overrated It 's mediocre cheesesteak I 've better local bodega Do n't go high expectations,1
805,I 've Pats many times late night morning brunch I Geno 's friend bought u steak dinner It tasted good I got WORST food poisoning life night It wa thing I ate aside single miller light I assume wa steak I wa sick next hour could n't leave house let alone bathroom Sticking Pats future,1
806,Ehhhhh cheesesteak forgettable definitely tourist trappy I n't try Pat 's I ca n't compare I probably wo n't go back try either Also huge fan top ~patriotism~ theme going,1
807,Geno 's definitely interesting place 's tourist attraction place eat cheesesteak If want actual cheesesteak find pizza place The cheese fry good really worth price,1
808,The definition bad cheesesteak locals The reason I give two star ordinary tourist would n't know better This place attraction Pretty much bad gets,1
809,So living NJ whole life I finally made trip Geno 's This place doe live hype The food wa cooked fresh We ordered given food like second later So basically food hanging waiting placed roll That doe sound appetizing The sandwich wa horrible good There wa like piece meat roll mostly uncooked onions Oh I n't aware n't cut steak like typical cheese steak It 's le like slab meat The roll wa ok Most staff appeared annoyed Maybe tired working tourist attraction Who knows I probably never go back Oh I almost forgot minute went sit older guy claim worked wa trying bum cigarette people -__-,1
810,Most time I purchase steak n't come live cook came cooked pot Pat 's Steaks fresh cooked I would go Pat 's steak,1
811,What greasy sad disappointment I wa deciding I wanted Pat 's Geno 's time I n't tried either I chose go shorter line wa obviously wrong choice I landed uncomfortable greasy neon afterglow terrible sandwich I 'm giving star I think even crummy cheesesteak still star cheesesteak .. cheesesteaks awesome Wait line go Pat 's even better skip nonsense together,1
812,Tried first time hype Really I expected trying cheesesteak place Philly Definitely tourist attraction .. usually hole wall n't lights glitz glamour way better,1
813,The Philly cheesesteak showdown went Genos versus Pats This one area need pas 're visiting Philly It 's located typical Philly neighborhood surrounding brick houses plenty people lot activity playground Back steak Their sandwich similar size meat portion seem Pats bread little tougher Genos But Genos bread actually taste richness bread Genos onion cheese hand winner Overall unanimous decision go Genos,1
814,I tried Geno 's Pat 's one right No I eat two full cheesesteaks within matter minutes thankyouverymuch I bite one I say n't anything special price definitely anything special I chose I like Geno 's better,1
815,It 's I expected Greasy meat onion great piece bread 's part Philly experience We got right huge lunch rush lasted rest time I 'd venture say Whiz wit would awesome 2am way home bar though I 'll try Pat 's next compare I 've got ta get roast pork people rave I love sandwiches,1
816,Every time I go south philadelphia make point stop Pat 's geno 's I love little difference two,1
817,I 'm one write bad review 's never I find place absolutely ridiculous I came see hype wa came conclusion wa NOT taste quality food Hundreds celebrity photo 's autograph make people come back saddens see skewed humanity 's perception longer even use judgement personal taste value food eat Because 'celebrities dined spot 's automatically supposed make food something delicious Ridiculous Do n't Just n't waste time money,1
818,Geno 's Las Vegas South Philly open 24/7 bright heck night This place draw completely different crowds depending time day My fair assessment Lunch Tourists Dinner Locals Overnight The After-Partiers Whenever go prepared stand line and/or lose place n't order English But n't love splash orange fake cheese white bread lot grease-soaked meat I sometimes While `` Pat 's Geno 's '' slogan resonates throughout City Brotherly Love good cheesesteaks favorite always Jim 's South,1
819,If I pick Pat 's Geno 's I guess I would pick Geno 's .. though came I would really pick neither I prefer cheesesteak hoagie Barrel 's 18th Wolf though I wish stop skimping meat Anyway .. back Geno 's ... picture .. 's 2AM hot summer night little much drink decide every Philly native doe pop Geno 's Well .... 2AM hot summer night Philly air wa thick smell steak onion garbage .... least wa I wa It wa nauseating made lose appetite I got fry soda called morning,1

856,Before I moved PA I heard rivalry Geno 's Pat 's And first time I visited Philly I alternated two trying figure better I 'm pretty sure I wa leaning towards Geno 's I realized They n't chop meat I prefer whole slice meat cheesesteak rather meat chopped I try go Geno 's every time I 'm Philly In fact last February I came late flight wanted grab something quick eat I drove home Lehigh Valley course I detoured right Geno 's bright neon lights It doe get VERY busy especially weekend around midday I try hit hour Otherwise 'll wait long line probably able find table Oh 's tip know want money ready cash get window And want Wiz Wit,1

863,Though Geno 's ha far autographed celebrity picture 's neon lighted walls doe make good Philly cheesesteak The meat come rather thick slices far drier ... overall 's tasty They n't offer many cheesesteak option menu either mushrooms pepper Thumbs,1
864,Waste money This cheesesteak look like put one slab steakums The roll good I 'm paying eat roll Seriously walk across street real cheesesteak pat 's,1

868,The bread wa chewy good way meat onion tasted like McDonalds They HOT SAUCE wa great But RUDE Dude gross teeth attitude Go rhyme sat start `` P '',1
869,Forgettable say least Start staff I n't find cute amusing damn rude wear like badge honor Customers pay bill joint last time I checked quit treating like 2nd class citizens Next cash It 's cash dying little every day seems weird take card Next value Generally place n't take cards 's making effort keep price pay merchant fee credit card machines But place charge 9.50 sandwich 2.00 tiny soda 4.00 fries exactly value Lastly food Simply bland The meat scarce lack seasoning The cheese scarce enough moisten meat The onion bulky easy eat Overall I say hype surrounding place hype It 's justified least 's worth time Try elsewhere,1

879,How say `` Two dogfood sandwich floppy Sarcone 's knock-off rolls please '' Telagu,1
880,Go Pat instead More real Philadelphia feel Geno 's The proudly displayed sign racism left sour taste mouth,1
881,My family I decided take Pat 's vs. Geno 's challenge In opinion I liked flavor steak cheese better Geno 's Pat 's However large sign saying `` America order English '' wa ignorant thing I 've ever seen large city Philadelphia We live America diverse beautiful country tolerate distasteful humor,1
882,Not expectations WOW wa disappointed I thought sure would better pats After reading multiple review I wa convinced I always fan touristy place although I might getting best philly cheesesteak saying I came would worth My husband I split cheesesteak pat one genos The cheesesteak genos wa bad didnt even finish order another one pats Absolutely cheez wiz wa watered goey didnt look like wa cheese The steak wa tough thick The juice sandwich made bread soggy messy eat The people rude place well They yelled customer going across street cant park car towed So I guess street Im glad parked across street bought sandwich pat one said anything us,1

890,Detroit native husband I challenge Geno 's Pats opinion I liked flavor better Geno 's I thought cheese wa tastier onion sweeter Overall 's good sandwich HOWEVER `` America speak English '' propaganda EVERYWHERE huge turn-off I n't live Philly I know melting pot 's pretty clear name like GENO 're probably immigrant family It 's clear plenty place I 've tried instead,1
891,All cheesesteaks essentially garbage Take good piece meat slice paper thin overcook cover greasy onion cheese whiz They glorious like abomination cook morning kitchen So I 'm asked best cheesesteak city I say Pat 's add `` It 's 's NOT GENO 'S open hour day -but eat finished drinking south philly 's 2:30 morning last cigarette gone thing gotten Truly Dark Otherwise go Paesano 's '' There 's nothing technically wrong food Geno 's buy 'steak Geno 's supporting aggressive racism In middle heavily Vietnamese/Central/South American neighborhood neon citadel junk food covered sign saying `` THIS IS AMERICA PLEASE ORDER IN ENGLISH '' Geno 's long term embarrassment testament Philadelphia 's long mean race relation history well interminable slightly le mean present future Support Philadelphia brotherly love n't English speakers give diarrhea Pat 's instead Geno 's,1
892,Geno 's Cheesesteak wa top list place go eat Philly I ordered provolone cheesesteak onion side cheese fries Fries cheesesteaks ordered different counters I guess I high expectation place since everyone raf I didnt enjoy cheesesteak It tasted like something I could order food truck DC There 's limited outdoor seating diner eat relatively quickly 's quick turnaround,1
893,a-OK,1
894,CHEESESTEAK WAR Geno 's v Pat 's I know nearly every food lover want come Philly ha heard Geno 's Steaks rival across street name Pat 's I would also assume food lover 've seen many challenge Food Network pit head head Now I might making even crazier assumption anything like 've wanting come Philly taste comparison It 's okay admit 're safe zone No judgment ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ THE EXPERIENCE Geno 's Pat 's indeed literally across street one another probably within feet I preference I ate first happened Pat 's open parking space outside place stopped Less minute splitting steak two young boys ordering second steak Geno 's The time wa 11:45am crowds If one thing I immediately notice wa incredibly clean Geno 's inside I 'm talking immaculate The exterior counter spotless sidewalk table swept clean inside kitchen wa like stepping operation room hospital It wa clean looked almost new This wa huge unexpected bonus germaphobe like ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ THE CHEESE-STEAK COMPARISON Let say plainly I probably disappointed either steaks I spent hour reading local blog yelp trying decide ha best cheese-steaks city After I may back way long time wanted best experience Pat 's consistently made multiple top list Geno 's I almost decided try two place instead stuck gun fulfill long standing food goal I 'm fan cheese whiz understatement I hate stuff wanted go provolone instead But I n't I wanted real Philly experience I chose whiz whiz I ca n't explain taste different much better authentic Philadelphia cheesesteak I wa pleasantly surprised much I enjoyed flavor wa I converted believer ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FINAL THOUGHTS These two cheese-steak Titans worthy visit despite might read comparative article internet Locals may feel place around town better I say certain I wa happy first authentic experience two long standing locations Both continuous operation since 's As out-of-town tourist I give edge Pat 's They seem dice meat finely whereas Geno 's give larger slices I think slight difference make ALL difference I also liked fry much much better Pat 's bread wa liking Geno 's Decide personal taste preference lean heavily towards Pat 's youtube.com/watch v=i78B…,1

1358,Geno 's popular tourist attraction South Philly also sell cheesesteaks I say frequent argument regarding iconic sandwich `` Pat 's Geno 's '' The answer anyone life knows neither Better steak local chain well many Philly street corners Geno 's fine It ha walk-up window customer order food ENGLISH dammit They make point letting know help rid line pesky foreigner `` biftecks du fromage '' whatever window pick outdoor seating enjoy food whatever language want Service 'd expect stationary food cart Make order get food go away If want bottle service valet parking 've come wrong cheesesteak spot The actual food fine well The steak smallish tasty fry made fresh hot enough salt n't screw fountain soda either Nothing rave veterans newcomer cheesesteak experience likely enjoy Overall Geno 's solid representation cheesesteaks anyone n't one I imagine Geno 's Philly Statue Liberty New York ... go come live,1
1359,What I n't like slice frozen bull meat get much gristle make chewy The fry good considering come pellet form water lol Sorry since Bobby left God rest soul DOWNHILL,1

1362,I 've two summer ago completely honest I wa disappointed Why come Philly Cheesesteak food cart Philadelphia offer equally authentic cheesesteak sandwiches The magic cheese whiz wa little unappetizing people n't come food `` been-there done-that experience '' To disappointment cashier shouted seemingly taken time order corrected incorrectly calling fry `` French Fries '' instead `` American Fries '' Sorry sorry I n't time finish reading menu I wa yelled I think Asian-American made situation worse based way I wa treated cashier Italian Market street past 6pm made feel place uncomfortable To fair wa one first experience anywhere outside UCity I heart Pat 's across street nicer I n't personally Aside bad treatment I 'm glad I 've made trip whenever asked `` Pat 's Geno 's '' question I always gladly pick Pat 's even though I n't At least I n't think I 'll yelled cashier,1
1363,Sure 's famous 's far best town I know angry guy behind counter yelling `` Hurry order '' supposed part experience whatever I 'd rather go nice family run place get much better food without hassle,1
1364,I wish wa case conversation best cheesesteaks Philly came Pat 's versus Geno 's The reality place hype substance If looking fun touristy experience mean go either establishments Either restaurant great way end bachelor party guys night However guy interested great sandwich social scene I would n't waste time If swayed food quality taste want best cheesesteak opposed social experience go Jim 's South Street Dellasandro 's Ridge Mama 's Bala Cynwyd,1
1365,Quick service sliced steak American cheese nice bun filling liked better Pat 's,1
1366,good philly cheesesteak 's little pricey n't offer water weird cheese fry delicious also much,1
1367,You 're either Pat 's guy Geno 's guy I Geno 's guy way It 's classic Philly establishment Philly attitude I love It 's staple community 's got great food boot I love hearty cheesesteaks 're probably favorite in-city joint Only thing disappointing lack seating get crowded,1
1368,Food wa ok employee friendly racist generalize wa disrespectful attraction PA Big NO NO,1
1369,This definite tourist trap And local really hit late night extremely drunk nothing else open I better cheese steak around town Overpriced greasy gross,1
1370,I like Geno 's I like Pats I like But Geno 's make feel little `` Philly '' I like attitude I ca n't help And frankly compared Pat 's LOT cleaner I sort skev Pats Jim 's South Tony Luke 's well Delissandro 's still favorites late night grub Geno 's RULES,1
1371,Always great people watching especially late night The drunker better steaks Still even S faced great Whatever make opinion 's worth experience least,1
1372,Too hyped Definately prefer Pat 's,1
1373,Tourist trap plenty better option elsewhere,1
1374,Whats trip Philadelphia without stoping Its large sandwich full meat toppings You feel hungry eating one world famous Cheese-Steak sandwiches It clean inside get pay nice big sandwich You go wrong trying world famous Geno 's cheese-steak ..,1
1375,When come rivalry Pat 's v Geno 's Pats wins Geno 's ha weird taste part product The bread seems whiz congealed steak whole good concept get really stringy I avoid Geno 's tell person visiting Philadelphia also avoid,1
1376,Pats Genos -- tourist trap cheesesteaks lot character Take out-of-towners know real local go John 's Roast Pork Tony Lukes Dalessandro 's etc The plus convenient location Italian Market open like 24/7 Whiz wit way go Get pepper pepper bar,1
1377,Pats Genos Philadelphia institutions ..... terrible terrible institutions Save calories If tourist go experience promptly go somewhere else cheesesteak,1
1378,Philly classic made even famous late Joey Vento 's insistance ordering English This late night Philly tradition 're drunk need soak alcohol 'll find times I If 're going go cheesesteak lunch dinner looking gourmet version n't What get large hearty sandwich first window average fry drink second I guess 're local live walking distance try thing menu drove took cab like people 're cheesesteak The strict rule ordering mostly tongue cheek 'll see every person line ignore sign order way n't intimidated The staff realize livelihood depends tourist dollars n't let attitude fool,1
1379,Wanted try original cheesesteaks I went Pat 's Geno 's The difference wa I got Whiz Pat 's provolone Geno 's Overall 're though seemed like bread wa better Pat 's Overall I give nod Pat 's honestly get better cheesesteak 'll find either one,1
1380,Great Philly Cheesesteaks like Pat 's across street suffer problem Miserable staff It kind running joke place order wrong get mad Sometimes I think good idea move find new job miserable show 's work Again great food terrible attitudes,1
1381,A famous flamboyant part South Philly Geno 's experience unique Philadelphia The cheesesteaks fry drinks bit overpriced rudeness bigotry `` English speaker '' off-putting huge collection law-enforcement patch cynical interpretation disturbing ode authoritarian establishment rarely seen A possible plus Geno 's aways seems somewhat busy I n't wait long line eat unlike Jim 's I wait hour The cheesesteak enjoyable wa otherworldly might claim others might expect Despite I admit I enjoy gaudiness neon bright-as-day light come night There certain `` fun '' quality place attracts sort people locals tourists young old panhandlers I even saw `` Santa '' Christmas season eating cheesesteak hard day 's work still full costume Geno 's place come want good value great food It n't earn amount business get taste quality service The draw Geno 's somewhat tenuous claim history authenticity largely countered Disneyland-esque fakeness But I would say 's worth visiting seeing light night trying cheesesteak `` wit provolone onions '' comparing one found across street Pat 's enjoying uniquely Philadelphian experience,1
1382,Geno 's used great The last time I went meat sandwich lot fat I wo n't go back,1
1383,Tourist trap .... next one,1
1384,Leg second place winner unofficial cheesesteak throw Tony Luke 's blew water Bread prefab taste texture n't get wrong till fairly tasty cheesesteak,1
1385,Nothing tourist trap First time Philly felt needed try authentic Philly cheesesteak I 've FAR better one MD Bread wa good little meat cheese It 's pain find parking little narrow streets Do n't waste time Seriously .... reading .... skip,1
1386,Perfectly fine cheesesteaks line Geno 's Pat 's always long tourists If want go one `` famous '' places check probably wo n't disappoint Of two I generally prefer Pat 's mostly racial issue le glitz light Geno 's I 'd go Cosmi 's either two big one though,1
1387,You come Pat 's Geno 's history food quality While still argue wa first I 'll let judge whose taste better And since literally across street I encourage 've always done try real Philly experience Besides dinging either one place taste would like giving Liberty Bell bad rating ha crack n't ring pure anymore These place historic institution heart Philly 's heritage With said I 've coming since 's money right slight leaning towards Geno 's Here 's breakdown Pat 's dryer bread meat crunchy onion cheaper wiz harsher service Geno 's juicy meat carmelized onion steamed roll gooey cheese friendlier staff While institutions I prefer greasy juicy flavor dripping cheesteak A couple final recommendation stepping window read instruction learn lingo It 's rather simple broken three steps And bring cash n't take plastic This definitely make experience memorable one Both place famous reason one `` must-see-stops '' tour Philadelphia,1
1388,Good definitely best battle Cheesesteaks place around 4th book Pats across street better even still two better Stever Princes Jims Steaks,1
1389,Highly Over rated Both Ginos Pats,1
1390,It 's fine Bread wa good Steak wa okay though difficult eat due size pieces Fried onion fine I ca n't understand cheese whiz thing save life I skipped provolone I new area try I find one make understand city famous cheese steak,1
1391,Business brought Philly I try place since I 've heard friend various Food network shout outs Well wa anything I expected The steak wa extremely bland severe lack flavor The bread wa absolute 'meh I say Geno 's clean bright folk seemed tad friendlier side compared Pat 's King Steaks ... sandwich n't good Oh ... 's pricey overrated steak cheese sandwich nuts,1
1392,I moved Philly thought I try Geno 's vs. Pat 's thing I happened order Geno 's first simply wa closer I ordered `` provolone '' I got wa mediocre cheesesteak side racism The bread wa good steak wa overcooked onion big little flavor Even provolone wa flavorless kind became indistinguishable bread I n't try `` freedom fries '' I assume would bland steaks albeit freedom Whatever means The `` speak English '' sign delightfully ironic handful white people eating Geno 's Pat 's wa bustling much multi-ethnic crowd Anyway best cheesesteaks made `` Murika '' give Geno 's try For best cheesesteak Philly 'd better pretty much anywhere else,1
1393,I 'm Philly girl Therefore I 've tried countless cheesesteaks different places This place far one worst cheesesteaks I 've ever eaten For price charge I would think quality would little better I still ca n't figure hype Til day I still n't know The meat dry big chunky It 's like chop meat toss grill leave juice drain hours I n't feel like I choking everytime I bite chew darn thing As cheese mushrooms taste like straight The reason I 'm giving star 's thing yummy pickled pepper sits outside part Geno 's condiments Do favor save time money Definitely worth go tourist well locals,1
1394,Steves Prince Steaks actually best center city location ecstatic lack meat taste make,1
1395,I personally choose Pat 's Geno 's really ca n't go wrong either,1
1396,Most disgusting Cheesesteak Philadelphia It Tourist I reason go unless I want go bathroom afterwards TMI I know true Tourist beware Philly cheesesteak supposed taste like Try Joe 's formerly known Chinks best cheesesteak city,1
1397,Having tried places Geno 's definitely much better Pat 's Compared else city ha offer however Geno 's n't cut,1
1398,It 's funny Geno 's directly across street Pat 's Actually quite smart bc people bound go try least compare .... well 's I After philly cheese steak Pats bf I walked Geno 's I must say preferred Geno 's We ordered That mean onions The bread roll egg wash gloss top chewy texture I liked The steak wa thick slice really beef flavor We also ordered provolone Geno 's sammich wa also quite huge Good thing I shared one,1
1399,Ate Geno 's recent trip Philadelphia The sandwich wa good I liked Pat best Everyone group seemed different take Pat 's v Geno 's debate I guess 's matter personal preference Try em decide,1
1400,Dissapointing My wife I town visiting San Francisco wanted `` eat Philly Cheesesteak Philly '' We heard alot Geno 's decided try It literally took second time ordered receiving food The meat wa pre cooked onion already grilled bread wa cold It wa slapped together seconds We extremely dissapointed,1
1401,noone go friends family tourist,1
1402,Sorry I 'd say Pat 's better cheesesteak two It n't good It might got Geno 's whiz wit Pat 's whiz witout chose provolone instead true competition anymore I know I soon found I n't fan whiz Onions also raw cooked like Pat 's Did n't enjoy,1
1403,Geno 's ha one worst steak Philly owner seems like xenophobic jerk boot yeah n't go,1
1404,Come bye take photo go get better cheese steak somewhere else There nothing special steak bucks Not worth trip,1
1405,Okay cheese steak I gave Pat 's liked Geno 's better Geno 's get I would say service people work Geno 's much friendly compared Pat 's Luckily I wa area wa huge line place I got try compare Overall place ehh .. Geno 's better term flavor bread/roll The meat Pat 's wa juicy compared Geno 's wa little bit drier side I would probably go either place given I find better cheese steak NYC The one I make home also taste good ... course I get meat If 're Philly never tried Pats Geno 's I would recommend try experience expectation far food/taste You rather disappointed,1
1406,Eek Methinks If true Philadelphian know best cheesesteaks found local corner store 'd never wait line dollar steaks Nuff said,1
1407,chewy bread tough steak enough cheese whiz,1
1408,The cheese-steak wa okay The onion added good chintzy provolone The hot sauce wa hot,1
1409,geno 's wa better pat 's sandwich wa bit better Service wa good get whole ordering sandwich separate soda french fries I would thought busy multiple windows either way wa ok one done kind place said Pat 's dont know quality wa I came 330am,1
1410,I appreciated quality bread proper proportioning composition sandwich- wa perfectly balanced overpowered wiz example The fault I found wa meat n't seasoned might plus cheesesteak purists onion served raw sandwich possible cheesesteak intended served,1
1411,I really like bread The meat n't chopped n't come normal cheesesteak It reminds steak-um n't taste store bought Not lot cheese lot onions kinda blah I normally n't take people town I better cheesesteak place Geno 's v Pat 's challenge classic Cheese fry alright The sign around Geno 's disturbing I n't know much back story annoy probably half reason I n't frequent place,1

1928,There 're really n't much else I add feedback already given review already Yelp place wa really disappointing All I say 're going despite reviews lower expectations might enjoy food bit I think could tell line Geno 's n't popular one since line wa much shorter Pat 's across street One really great thing Geno 's They 're really quick fulfill order,1
1929,We hurried across street Geno 's heart pounding Could usurp delectable Pat 's cheesesteak affections Thankfully answer Geno 's seemed much stylized Tons picture police `` patriotic '' saying pretty off-putting The sandwich wa served quickly. .but wa dry Also wa harder find seat Not soft cheesy Pat 's still Philly institution,1
1930,Is magic Genie I n't know Geno 's Poor Geno 's I high expectation since wa food channel Geno 's look iconic outside unfortunately feel like scam eat I lot problem food Geno 's The steak fatty thing reminded caviar Also Geno 's us slab meat kinda reminds high school cafeteria food On top canned mushrooms stand gross way I love mushroom slimy thing big let Genos Pats Jim 's Philly Pat 's used least wa smart Also table gross I understand 're busy could I enjoy food I could n't find place sit except `` leaning '' old fashion ledge type area I find seat It wa gross I could barely eat There cheese stain everywhere ... plate messy hoagie felt like I wa melting nasty table I ate I wa probably nice star review There thing nice like feeling like I wa old fasion authentic Philly cheese steak joint I love red pepper Pat Geno 's But thing n't make There thing bothered I even left review nice,1
1931,Came Philadelphia mainly try Philly Cheesesteaks grabbing bite Pat 's go across street compare Geno 's Geno 's steak sliced instead chopped You know I hate say comparing Pat 's Pat 's definitely win challenge It might preference I find steak Geno 's somewhat bland Their service fast 's like BAM BAM BOOM If order slow pay slow feel like 're going get yelled HAHA,1
1932,This place sucked .. Do n't believe hype ... I tried pat way better Geno 's .but I never come ny either I make better home What let,1

1936,I live block genos I even Im drunk starvin I never go back It tasteless food I ever,1
1937,Great cheesesteaks nomnomnom,1
1938,All time best cheesesteaks `` wiz wit '' Sorry Pats fans I 'm cheese bottom steak whatever reason Ah college memory standing line I 'm getting hungry reminiscing,1
1939,Stay away I would give place negative star I could First cheese steak beef wa dry tough onion raw rather sauteed 've pepper mention mushrooms wa served cheese wiz rather um actual cheese Second price bad sandwich following notable wait line scam Third perhaps importantly staff environment place Geno 's arguably xenophobic sign like `` This America speak English '' Never mind n't national language founder Geno 's wa Italian presumably spoke uh Italian There wa also shrine-like photo cop killed year ago struck well odd perhaps obsessive Then face photo Geno Glenn Beck Geno Rush Limbaugh oh look Geno Sean Hannity Then course token picture scantily clad teenager females course Overall wa really white trashy decor The staff n't worth much commentary generally trashy I wonder even washed hand today eww 're handling sandwich middle-aged a-hole-ish could n't care le whether filled order correctly So given would ANYONE go place There 's one selling point I think ...,1
1940,Staff arrogant rude Standed line `` outside '' stunk mediocre food There plenty place get better cheesesteak without attitude Thumbs,1
1941,First I 'd like start saying people super nice compared environment get across street although I like Pat 's 'aggressive environment The steak wa good ... I n't like texture meat much places If like onions ... place n't fool around Good stuff star cause I like cheesesteak place Definitely nothing wrong place I 'd eat I wa area Pat 's line wa long ... purely preference call,1
1942,Definitely flashier two cornerstone cheesesteak competition We went Geno 's first drawn like moth hugely lit neon name Tried sandwich whiz cheese fries Underwhelming pomp circumstance surrounding joint At first kitsch entertaining picture frame mounted every available surface even awning 's ceiling featuring serviceman woman enjoying sandwich The patriotism took darker turn noticed deliberately anti-immigrant sign `` If read thank teacher read English thank marine '' etc I wa afraid eat front sign -- imagining dinner snatched hand I showed proper ID healthy tan I wa sporting Political taste aside food wa bland The meat wa dry onion slightly le The famed whiz wa cheap rubbery kind cemented fry one entity A good place hit 're interested local landmarks somewhere I would regularly throw ten mediumish meal,1
1943,Took drive family New Jersey Philadelphia Obviously checked tourist site one main reason I wanted go Philadelphia wa cheesesteaks Anyways got husband got cheesesteak `` wit wiz '' ... never tried ... I wa surprised tasty It wa kinda hard make true determination I also tried place across street But two I like Geno 's best,1

1946,Checked website Heard stories Gino 's bigot arguably racist DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ESTABLISHMENT I sloppily finished Pat 's sub Gino 's silent protest,1
1947,Went breakfast town The lady register wa courteous cheesesteak wa made pretty quickly Benches outside shop customers well condiments LOVED seeing English-only signs This place America,1
1948,Not big fan Geno 's I think steak bland highly dislike fact one option cheese steak I go `` signs '' location I would waste time going,1
1949,So promised I tried guy across street Overall steak wa OK cheese good bread wa chewy liking Good grease factor thing bring place Price steak drink ... I n't even bother fries I 'm sure cost food going funding touristy merch place Really You guy ca n't serve steaks Service surley ... even philly I 've better service kidney thieves The pro-police anti-immigrant crap I get cop great What I speak italian y'know like forefathers I still need 'order english If like great I 'll spend Pat 's,1
1950,Pat 's better Geno 's Pat 's ha better Geno 's life And Pat 's always better Geno 's I consider place embarrassment cheesesteaks Instead political propaganda concentrating actually putting fair amount meat sandwiches,1
1951,It happens time whenever successful business created someone rip crappier model right next door steal market share If usually prefer fake original 'll probably love Genos,1
1952,eating cheasesteak place dasy Geno 's The bread unique flavor differently soft The flavor meat wiz wa great,1
1953,Not even good drunk 2am,1
1954,Get cash ready know order get counter oh make sure speak English wo n't take order In city 'brotherly love I wa extremely disappointed sign clearly state speak English- Geno 's patriotic I give simply rude Their sandwich average Do go way go South Philly go across street Pat 's 's better sandwich price,1
1955,Sorry Geno 's But side side taste test Pat 's Geno 's bread better Pat 's overall whole package n't cut,1
1956,So I guess sandwich alright declared Mike superior Pat 's based cheese application roll cheese fry whatever Super salty soaked cheese especially bottom hot freshly fried pretty tasty Their regular fries doused ketchup much also That said get bent Geno 's Dude Geno 's suck I hate principle alone The service blows kitschy Weiner 's Circle way 's fun get yelled mistreated disgruntled staff Like actually bad part fun Everything grossly priced low-grade And serve Coke Pepsi products Mt Dew Wild Cherry Pepsi Cherry Coke sight And crudely displayed racist sentiment unappetizing sleazy Like amidst pro-police regalia appear anti-immigrant chain letter clearly printed Microsoft Word Geocities page generated back '00 Also picture Donald Trump I heard Sarah Palin Okay hell going What year Good thing I n't wear `` Free Mumia '' t-shirt day I 'm going decorate exterior building anit-Geno 's propaganda picture Barack Geno 's go hell BONUS CONTENT Some people come bad A lady front asked mushroom steak fry/soda line asked lemon Diet Coke Not lifetime dummy,1
1957,Visited Philly Memorial Day weekend I taken clue line Pat 's wa long line Geno 's wa non factor Ordered onion provolone cheese The bread wa good wa flavor beef wa kind dry Had put lot salt eat Go Pat 's cheesesteak It 's much better,1
1958,Geno 's okay I prefer Pats across street There always line well I learned quickly wen order cheessteak get cheese whiz I repeat get fancy get provolone cheese The bread good get onion pepper well You cant go wrong stop get cheese steak I lot place Philly place one better ones,1
1959,Meh I 'm Philadelphian I tell touristy pad ... The flashy light gaudy employee seriously need learn place If I want eat cheesesteak particular way 's I 'll eat Do n't arm-wrestle whatever want say tradition I rate place low pushiness lack interest catering customer No money going establishment,1
1960,If Philly Cheesesteak one essential food represents Philadelphia Geno definitely NOT place I came Philly along friend coworkers try two famous rival across street I say trying Geno 's Pat 's Pats across street win hand Geno 's selection good Pats beef kinda blah Not mention overall presentation Greasy tasteless Dry beef nasty beefy taste Cheese bland bread HARD chew ... I feel like must mixed gum making bread Its hard eat without condiments The thing I like store bright neon light I would highly suggest owner improve taste food spend le money advertising campaign,1
1961,They say Geno 's Pat 's rival end Who make best best Philly Cheese Steaks In opinoin I say Pat 's better choice Geno lack flavor texture wa ultimately soggy wasnt much kicker anything I got .. Even Cheese fry wa simply plain If Geno 's I recommend cross street Patt 's,1
1962,What Philly trip complete without visiting Geno 's Pat 's Ordered Geno 's provolone It wa okay time around While provolone steak proportion wa good compared Jim 's It wa still little bland side The bread wa really good though Overall n't meet expectations I think travel channel food network people make sandwich seem like best thing earth tone,1
1963,Very good worth taste,1
1964,They say tourist steak place disagree .. I always get wiz I love Never bad steak,1
1965,So 's whole rivalry Geno 's Pat 's Jets Sharks visiting Philly ate Geno 's I 'm exactly Cheez-Whiz fan apparently Pat 's stick `` original '' cheesesteak come Whiz When order cheesesteak n't want come like total tourist So want onions say `` '' want provolone whiz say either `` provolone '' `` whiz '' Pretty self explanatory So example I wanted cheesesteak onion provolone I would walk say `` With provolone '' `` provolone '' If wanted Whiz sandwich would literally walk window say `` Whiz '' Do n't doucher say `` '' hello 's cheesesteak -- 're supposed get kind cheese Anyway cheesesteak wa meh Also 's outdoor picnic-style seating 's clean cares You 're eating greasy sandwich fake cheese Bring hand sanitizer,1
1966,I dont understand place isnt rated good I loved place cheesesteaks like kind Cali Loved place Pat 's wa across street I went visiting I liked one better thats probably I split one brother messed Pat 's one cheese wiz I didnt like But loved place,1
1967,For n't know much Philly ... 's hint `` You ca n't live visit fly drive Philly try cheesesteak hoagie '' ... rivalry Pat 's king Geno 's Geno 's win book Yum,1
1968,As lifelong Pat 's fan I 'm reminded immortal word Blair Waldorf `` You disgusting I hate '',1
1969,I usually get cheesesteak `` wit wiz '' onion cheeze wiz Admittedly quality sandwich varies greatly Sometimes 's little much cheese bread little stale tasting whatever ... nonetheless overall 's always solid eat ... 's still better `` cheesesteaks '' area Philly comparing Geno 's place Philly 's another story/debate .... That said doe feel like giant tourist trap bit pricey really And n't expect cashier order taker friendly either .... know want step ordering counter order quickly If everybody employees customer line get mad P I 'm also super big fan Tea Party-esque political propaganda `` speak English '' sign posted everywhere either .... I 'll swing whenever I 'm area,1
1970,Was Philly night decided I stop check whole cheesesteak debate Pat 's wins I sure win Geno 's `` cleaner '' make sense Everything little polished detriment Weak bread weak serving size wayyyy much steakums cheeze wiz highway robbery place boonies The thing keeping place alive traffic get food channel I would suggest anyone make trek eat,1
1971,I really enjoyed cheesesteak Ketchup wa good since wa fresh hot sauce spicier average But I hated lighting ridiculous sign saying English wa allowed I 'm sure I speak English better folk I bet would n't stop giving sidelong glance even knew,1
1972,Geno 's weaker Pat 's flavor texture general Their bread pretty good though The flashy design big difference compared Pat 's subdued white paint job n't really impress much I ordered steak sandwich onion cheese whiz The meat wa cut bigger piece Pat 's fat making le appealing The overall flavor wa pronounced Pat 's left disappointed Many similarity abound place Pat 's Oddly enough pricing exactly Pat 's menu choice close well Even though 's right across street Pat 's Geno 's seems like 's less-friendly location -I wonder person secretly owns get profits I likely choose Geno 's next visit,1
1973,Geno 's v Pats= GENOS,1
1974,Whenever I 'm Philadelphia highlight trip visit Geno 's I tried Pat 's yet across street I 've always wanted The line place always long reason another Oooo look pretty lights I 've always stood front Geno 's I remember first time I bit one cheesesteaks I took good look wa confused It looked nothing like I eating years It n't taste like either SO WAIT ....

1975,Geno 's gave first authentic cheese-steak experience week ago 'm still craving another one The service wa lightning fast preserving quality sandwich I must admit 's purely junk food I n't feel like I overate I wa done I would given star sandwich Geno 's might overcharging little much,1

2570,Easily wa one best stop East Coast baseball Road trip Nothing like right Phillies game seeing many comrade Boston line let 's wear Red Sox shirts I wa little put anti-immigrant jabber plaguing establishment ... 's nothing I My beau felt nostalgic like wa Boyz II Men video And wa lit like Jesus Christmas So 'll call even The food wa great regret wa getting waiting second Philadelphia vacation Cheesesteaks South Philly Will go Geno 's also Pat 's comparison next visit Philly,1
2571,Place aiiiight I think Geno 's Pat 's across street got lucky weird phenomenon establishment become icon tourist attraction despite 's run-of-the-mill food item They n't even really try anymore reputation already entrenched mind public especially towner come say Like I sampled cheesesteaks day I wa Philly Geno 's wa worst I would say 're visiting definitely check so-called history rivalry Geno 's Pat 's But I actually lived Philly I probably would n't going often I would suggest trying cheesesteaks establishment compare Geno '' really anal enjoying non-Geno 's sandwich vicinity So split cheesteak friend Then cross street split cheesteak Pat 's If 're pick one two I would go Pat 's instead See Pat 's review,1
2572,So 's deal wife I wanted try famous cheesesteak debate try Geno 's Pat 's My wife wa worried one would get mad u eating one establishment crossing street try I wa like ... kidding know many tourist 're went I ordering Geno 's stumbled ordering process I said something like one regular cheesesteak please I said one wiz wit guy counter definitely knew wa tourist spoke The steak came seasoned perfectly right amount oozing cheese roll wa nice soft absorbing juices The thing keeping star besides attitude wa decor whole place I felt like I wa game show glitzy glamorous Just look night pic 'll see I mean continue onto Pat 's review,1
2573,Although 's good couple year since I 've eaten cheesesteak I figured I know enough place get good fact across goes Unless long obnoxious line take roller coaster concert lifetime truly epic event probably n't going worth waiting So see long line sandwich n't bother ESPECIALLY 're waiting pile junk Most real Philadelphians find wiz quite disgusting Hell 's probably toxic nature Fortunately though 's legit cheesesteak establishment able order `` wit '' American provolone cheese Contrary popular cheesesteak ordering belief `` wit wiz '' actually n't English So please stop clown Joey Vento Fact matter unless 're drunk enough point end regretting food choice next morning real Philadelphians n't bother Geno 's Pat 's Go Tony Lukes Steaks On South John 's Roast Pork hell ANY sandwich shop serf cheesesteak 're bound find something lot better And might even bother line server bad attitude favor n't believe hype come place,1
2574,Geno 's even worse Pat 's I think 're pretty crappy But Geno 's slice steak weird 's right The reason come late night 're looking good side show But 've seen 's reason go back Especially cheesesteaks,1
2575,The question South Philly always come Geno 's Pat 's It 's like Giordano 's versus Lou Malnati 's Chicago-style pizza -- might great pick favorite For I 'm going Geno 's focus meat rather Cheese Whiz I 'm also going say use whiz philly cheese steak ha got overrated culinary concept time dodges lightning bolt I think attitude Geno 's Pat 's accentuates life South Philly It 's sandwiches also distinct Philly flair service make place great And time little moment soapbox If restaurant request patron speak English right After freedom speech includes right state belief idea might construed offensive way English first language So basically going interpet sign offensive manner 's business probably wo n't like place However review based actual sandwich 's stellar,1
2576,Geno 's inferior Pat 's two reasons The first meat appears tougher gristle-ier Pat 's The second uber-tacky sign make corner look like Reno n't good thing,1
2577,Pat 's better Geno 's last two time wa Philly got one sat took bite Pat 's bite Geno 's I think onion bread Pat 's put top favorite Pat 's cheese steak wit onions wiz provolone yeah I 'm going die soon 's effing good way better Jim 's way better random spot sadly stopped Philly Geno 's outward appearance sign food well really n't like glitzy neon covered building roll crunchy much bread covering meatie cheesie goodness 's hidden inside I 've never service problem either sign telling order read follow 'll ok getting foods n't get wrong Geno 's great good Pats opinion,1
2578,There standard Cheesesteak place around Philadelphia -- Geno 's Pat 's Steve 's Jim 's Tony Luke 's I 'm going start saying somewhat similar general ha slight unique taste The one thing I say Geno 's impressed cleanliness inside I took tour inside kitchen freezer store meat across street I 've never seen anything clean two places Everything wa SUPER clean looked wa brand new When I think fast food I n't necessarily equate clean state kitchens Geno 's however another story -- good way I 'd eat simply I peace mind Geno 's take pride keeping place clean still serving ton customer everyday,1
2579,Sure eating Geno 's front Geno 's one thing But wrapping dozen tinfoil flying back DC going well guaranteed way make good friend better friends win friend 's girlfriend 's Dad grew South Philly Good thing I n't get pulled Apparently package three cheese-steaks tinfoil back seat look surprisingly like key either heroin cocaine know drug dog would lost mind extra wiz w/ onions I brought back two dozen ... many regrets ...,1

2581,For first time I went South Philly conduct `` The Ultimate Philly Cheese Steak Challenge '' boyfriend sister The first thing I thought I went Geno 's wa wa lot cleaner brighter newer looking Pat 's Quite honestly Pat 's looked like run-down traditional cheese steak stand When I went Geno 's line wa long I really appreciated n't ordering system like Pat 's We bought cheese steak Whiz onion fries I absolutely hated fries Maybe wa discrete way saying `` Get cheese fries '' regular fry tasteless It tasted like fry stored closet full mothballs Yuck Nonetheless cheese steak wa fine The steak wa juicier meet definition good steak I also tasted lot onion sandwich So three star better sandwich specialty horrible side dish fries,1
2582,I like beef much next girl A little beefy The steak n't cut nice thin wa moist restaurant-that-shall-not-be-named across street I gave five star review Hubby I split intersection He went Geno 's I went polar opposite read yummy Geno 's across street We ordered sandwich met completely unbiased corner split sandwich compare two cheese steak giants Ahem Bread A little tough honestly hard chew I 'm dentures I 'm healthy gums like little toughness This wa much Meat A little thick little consistent color making feel wa highly processed Cheese A little unmelty That 's cardinal rule making cheese steak sandwich You HAVE TO MELT THE CHEESE Duh Everyone know So I safely say place ha vote Even though patron Geno 's stupid enough file line people middle intersection 'll go Pat 's patron line sidewalk safely Maybe sign ....,1
2583,Had first Geno 's steak today I gave due onion really good The onion thing redeeming experience Everyone commented already neon light xenophobia I 'll focus cheesesteak My first impression wa sandwich wa really small Maybe I wa extra hungry My second impression wa meat wa terrible It wa like one frozen steak-ums A distinct lack flavor left underwhelmed No need third impression ...,1
2584,If cheesesteak lunch wo n't need dinner,1
2585,While visiting Philly first time weekend I get Cheese steak We trusty tour guide took `` best '' referred Geno 's It 's comic little stand order steak counter At one window I ordered steak provolone another window I ordered fry drinks The cheese steak came instantly The bread wa warm filled thin slice beef diced sauteed onion melted provolone cheese It wa yummy gross fatty kinda way Fries good,1

It took minute dish served Not fast opinion We people ordered Chicken Burritos Beef Burritos Chicken Quesadillas Enchiladas Vegetarian Tacos Burritos American style one friend commented tasted good I found beans cheese cabbage chicken fillings I liked Quesadillas wa soft strong taste cheese Another friend felt cheese wa Mexican orange color signaled wa likely cheddar cheese Enchiladas sweet spicy enough Vegetarian Tacos wa full vegetable looked healthy The flour tortilla served taco taste extremely fresh Maybe purchased stored rather made restaurant We also ordered Mexico-made sodas Different flavors different colors right sweetness made real sugar nice change normal soda menus The price wa relatively low portion wa big We spent per person including tips I managed finish half burritos In conclusion though meal wa authentic expected tasted bad least worth money paid The environment service barely satisfactory,0
